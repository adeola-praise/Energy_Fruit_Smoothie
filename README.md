# Energy_Fruit_Smoothie
A C# console application that calculates the amount of calories in a fruit smoothie and determines if it gives sufficient energy.
## Project Description
A list of five fruits is provided for the user to make a fruit smoothie. The smoothie has to be made from at least two fruits and at most five fruits, hence there are only limited fruit options and a fruit cannot be chosen more than once.<br >
<br >
Each fruit has two varieties with different calorie values from which the user can decide to use. For example the fruit "Apple" can have two varieties: Sliced Apple, Chopped Apple.<br >
<br >
The entire fruit choice of the user is stored and a smoothie is made. The total calorie value of the smoothie is returned and compared with some standard values that determine if the smoothie is a Low Energy Smoothie, Perfect Energy Smoothie or High Energy Smoothie.
## Why I Built this Project
This project was built to help me to master the basics of C# programming language. Building this project has helped me implement my knowledge of: Classes, Methods, Access Modifiers, Lists, Loops, Exceptions, etc in C# programming.
